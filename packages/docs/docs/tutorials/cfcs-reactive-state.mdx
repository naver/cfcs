**Reactive State** refers to a state that changes according to a specific condition.

### ⚙️ Installation
```sh
$ npm install @cfcs/core
```

### Reactive State

`Reactive State` is a great extension for `Vanilla` as well.

Because you can get properties that can be obtained from events in one `Reactive State`.

If you can get properties through events you would use something like this:

```js
// AS-IS
inst.on("event1", e => {
  console.log(e.prop1);
});
inst.on("event2", e => {
  console.log(e.prop1);
});
```

If you want to directly detect the state value, you can use it in the following way.

```js
// TO-BE
inst.subscribe("prop1", nextValue => {
  console.log(nextValue);
});
```

In this case, state detection is more intuitive than event detection.


* Class
  * [`ReactiveSubscribe`](/docs/api/Core/Reactive-Decorator/Function/ReactiveSubscribe) is a class decorator and adds `.subscribe` and `.unsubscribe` methods.
  * [`Observe`](/docs/api/Core/Reactive-Decorator/Function/Observe) is a property decorator and converts the property into a `reactive state`. You can detect its status through `.subscribe`.
```ts
import { ReactiveSubscribe, Observe } from "@cfcs/core";

@ReactiveSubscribe
class Component {
  @Observe value1 = 1;

  constructor() {
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      this.value1 = 2;
    });
  }
}

interface Component extends ReactiveSubscribe<{
  value1: number;
  value2: number;
}> {}

const component = new Component();

// 1
console.log(component.value1);

component.subscribe("value1", nextValue => {
  // When the change event occurs => (2, 2)
  console.log(nextValue, component.value2);
});
```

* Inline Object
  * [`reactive`](/docs/api/Core/Reactive/Function/reactive) converts the object into a reactive object, and values can be changed through `.subscribe`.


```js
import { reactive } from "@cfcs/core";

const obj = reactive({
  value1: 1,
});


// 1
console.log(obj.value1);

obj.subscribe("value1", nextValue => {
  // When the change event occurs => (2, 2)
  console.log(nextValue, obj.value1);
});


obj.value1 = 2;
```
