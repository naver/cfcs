import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import { FrameworkTabs } from "@site/src/components/FrameworkTabs";

### ⚙️ Installation
```sh
$ npm install @cfcs/core
```

### Reactive State


`Reactive State` is a great extension for `Vanilla` as well.

Because you can get properties that can be obtained from events in one `Reactive State`.

```js
// AS-IS
// If you can get properties through events you would use something like this:
inst.on("event1", e => {
  console.log(e.prop1);
});
inst.on("event2", e => {
  console.log(e.prop1);
});

// TO-BE
// However, if it can be detected directly through the property value, it will be easy to figure out.
inst.subscribe("prop1", nextValue => {
  console.log(nextValue);
});
```

* Class
  * `ReactiveSubscribe` is a class decorator and adds `.subscribe` and `.unsubscribe` methods.
  * `Observe` is a property decorator and converts the property into a `reactive state`. You can detect its status through `.subscribe`.
```ts
import { ReactiveSubscribe, Observe } from "@cfcs/core";

@ReactiveSubscribe
class Component {
  @Observe value1 = 1;

  constructor() {
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      this.value1 = 2;
    });
  }
}

interface Component extends ReactiveSubscribe<{
  value1: number;
  value2: number;
}> {}

const component = new Component();

// 1
console.log(component.value1);

component.subscribe("value1", nextValue => {
  // When the change event occurs => (2, 2)
  console.log(nextValue, component.value2);
});
```

* Inline Object
  * `reactive` converts the object into a reactive object, and values can be changed through `.subscribe`.
```js
import { reactive } from "@cfcs/core";

const obj = reactive({
  value1: 1,
});


// 1
console.log(obj.value1);

obj.subscribe("value1", nextValue => {
  // When the change event occurs => (2, 2)
  console.log(nextValue, obj.value1);
});


obj.value1 = 2;
```
