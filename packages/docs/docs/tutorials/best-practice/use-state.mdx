## Use State

You can simply define the state via the [`reactive`](/docs/api/Core/Reactive/Function/reactive) function.

### Inline Object State {#inline-object-state}

```js
import { reactive } from "@cfcs/core";

const obj = reactive({
  width: 0,
  height: 0,
});
```

### Class State {#class-state}

If you have a class component that you manage, it is also a good choice to support Reactive in the class component.

Make the class reactive through the class decorator called [`ReactiveSubscribe`](/docs/api/Core/Reactive-Decorator/Function/ReactiveSubscribe).

The state is set through a property decorator called [`Observe`](/docs/api/Core/Reactive-Decorator/Function/Observe).

```js
import { ReactiveSubscribe, Observe } from "@cfcs/core";

@ReactiveSubscribe
class ClassComponent {
  @Observe width = 0;
  @Observe height = 0;
}

const obj = new ClassComponent();
```

## Use Adapter With State
Reactive Adapter is an intermediate stage code to support the framework.

If you can create an adapter, you can create a reactive component in the framework supported by CFCS.


It provides a reactive adapter in the form of a function, and you can complete the adapter by writing the code for the function.

The return value of Adapter returns [inline object](#inline-object-state) or [class instance](#class-state) or void as an instance.
If void is returned, an instance can be set in the `mounted` lifecycle. See [`Use Lifecycle`](/docs/best-practice/use-lifecycle).

```js
const REACTIVE_ADAPTER = () => {
};
```

[See Function Adapter's setup](/docs/api/Core/Reactive/Interface/ReactiveSetup)


The following code is an example of defining `width` and `height` state.


And when the state changes, re-rendering occurs in the parent component (or app) that used the component.
```js
import { reactive } from "@cfcs/core";

const REACTIVE_ADAPTER = () => {
  const obj = reactive({
    width: 0,
    height: 0,
  });

  // Changing the state in the created Lifecycle will not cause a re-render.
  // obj.width = 100;
  // obj.height = 100;

  return obj;
};
```


### Frameworks

<FrameworkTabs>
  <TabItem value="react">

If you don't use the `height` value in the render lifecycle, re-rendering won't happen even if the `height` state changes.


```jsx
import { useReactive } from "@cfcs/react";

export function App() {
  const {
    width,
    // height,
  } = useReactive(REACTIVE_ADAPTER);

  return <div>{width}</div>;
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vue2">

State in vue is [`ref`](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#ref), and in `setup`, you need to access it as `.value`.


```html
<template>
  <div>{width}x{height}</div>
</template>
<script>
import { useReactive } from "@cfcs/vue2";

export default {
  setup() {
    const {
      width,
      height,
    } = useReactive(REACTIVE_ADAPTER);

    return {
      width,
      height,
    };
  }
}
</script>
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="vue3">

State in vue is [`ref`](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#ref), and in `setup`, you need to access it as `.value`.



```html
<template>
  <div>{width}x{height}</div>
</template>
<script>
import { useReactive } from "@cfcs/vue3";

export default {
  setup() {
    const {
      width,
      height,
    } = useReactive(REACTIVE_ADAPTER);

    return {
      width,
      height,
    };
  }
}
</script>
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="svelte">

The state in svelte uses [store](https://svelte.dev/docs#component-format-script-4-prefix-stores-with-$-to-access-their-values) and accesses it with $ to get the value.

```html
<script>
import { useReactive } from "@cfcs/svelte";

const {
  width,
  height,
} = useReactive(REACTIVE_ADAPTER);

</script>
<div>{$width}x{$height}</div>
```


  </TabItem>
