CFCs(Cross Framework Components) are modules that convert components into framework usage.


To be able to use it in a framework means to use the framework like a framework.

React has a specific usage for React, and Vue has a Vue specific usage.

With CFCs, one code can support multiple frameworks according to the framework's usage.

## Who is it good for?

Many users use frameworks.

If it's a popular framework, it has a lot of components, but the newer the framework, the less components it has.

There are many well-made vanilla modules out there, and many that are not supported by the framework.
You will mostly choose to use vanilla components through the `mounted` lifecycle. However, this method will not be able to use all functions properly, and there will be components that are not suitable.

We thought about frameworks. Trends change and there is a possibility that we can support other frameworks someday.

1. **If I am a component provider, can I also create all framework components?**
2. **Is there a way to support existing components in the framework?**
3. **Can a feature be supported by multiple frameworks simultaneously?**

Then, **`Cross Framework Components`** is recommended.



## Concepts


Supporting multiple frameworks means that there is code for each framework, and the size can be doubled.

CFCs would like to introduce to you how to support multiple frameworks with one code through Compatible.

### CFCs Reactive
CFCs Reactive can support multiple frameworks as a Reactive Component, a utility component that is state-based and does not create a UI.

The Hooks component can provide us with a value for the state by changing the state designated as a Hook by certain conditions.

The state used in Hooks is called **Reactive State**.

### CFCs DOM

CFCs DOM supports various frameworks by delegating the DOM render function to the framework. (Soon)
